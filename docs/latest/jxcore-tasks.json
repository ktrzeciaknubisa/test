See the simplest example:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = function () {\n    console.log(&quot;this is message from thread no&quot;, process.threadId);\n};\n\njxcore.tasks.addTask(method);</code></pre>\n<p>Another one:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = {};\nmethod.define = function () {\n    require(&quot;./hello&quot;);\n    console.log(&quot;http server started on thread&quot;, process.threadId);\n    process.keepAlive();\n};\n\njxcore.tasks.runOnce(method);</code></pre>\n<p>Note that this particular example does nothing but running hello.js file in multiple threads.

But things can go also in many other ways: all of the 3 tasks can run in the same subthread, or two of them in one subthread, and the third in another, etc.</li>\n<li>Do not assume the tasks will be executed in the order of which they were added.</li>\n<li>When the task <code>method</code> returns from its execution block (for example by calling return statement),\nit is considered as completed.\nThis means, that if you use in the task code any delayed execution with <code>setTimeout()</code> or <code>setInterval()</code>, or async calls,\nthe task method may return faster, before those delayed/async jobs will have chance to complete.\nFor gaining control over task’s execution time, please use <code>process.keepAlive()</code> and <code>process.release()</code> methods from Subthreads API.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adding a task with one-argument callback:\n\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var method = function (param) {\n   console.log(&quot;We are in a subthread now.

If you will not do it, the <code>logic()</code> will never get called.\nThis mechanism is intended to be used in scenarios, when <code>define()</code> runs async work, and <code>logic()</code> should be run afterwards.\nWhenever <code>waitLogic</code> is used (set to <code>true</code>), the <code>callback</code> is not called after the task completes.
